A vector database for AI-powered search and retrieval
Stores, indexes, and retrieves high-dimensional embeddings
Enables semantic search, hybrid search, and generative AI applications
Why Use Weaviate?
Fast and scalable: Handles billions of vectors efficiently
Powerful retrieval: Supports vector search, hybrid search, and keyword filtering
Integrated with AI models: Works with OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, and more
Security and access control: Enterprise-ready with permissions and authentication
Real-time updates: Add, modify, or delete data dynamically

# Core Capabilities
Vector search: Find similar items based on meaning, not just keywords
Hybrid search: Combine vector embeddings and traditional keyword search
GraphQL API: Simple and flexible querying
Metadata filtering: Refine search with structured data
Scalability: Works on cloud, on-prem, or distributed setups
Common Use Cases
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Powering AI assistants
Semantic and hybrid search: Context-aware document retrieval
Recommendation systems: Personalized content suggestions
Enterprise knowledge management: Organizing unstructured data
